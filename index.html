  <section class="bio">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My journey into data analytics began with a curiosity about how informationâ€”when interpreted correctlyâ€”can solve real problems and drive meaningful outcomes. Starting my career as a Linux Administrator at JIO, I gained strong technical foundations in managing systems, automation, and structured operations. But my turning point came during my data analyst internship, where I was introduced to the power of analytics in uncovering trends, cleaning messy datasets, and driving decisions through dashboards and reporting tools.</p>
    <p>Now, as a Masterâ€™s student in Advanced Data Analytics at the University of North Texas, Iâ€™m focused on building the skills that make a true analyst valuable: data wrangling, visualization, storytelling, and problem-solving. I work regularly with tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel, and Iâ€™ve built dashboards, predictive scripts, and reporting pipelines that turn complex data into accessible insights. Whether it's identifying bottlenecks in operational workflows or mapping financial trends across loan portfolios, I love helping stakeholders make sense of data.</p>
    <p>My interests span healthcare, finance, government analytics, and public service, where data can improve systems and livesâ€”not just metrics. I believe in the value of collaboration, and Iâ€™ve learned the most while working on cross-functional teams with diverse perspectives. I take pride in not just understanding the technical side, but in communicating results clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.</p>
    <p>Looking ahead, I hope to grow in roles that allow me to use data to support evidence-based decisions, improve performance, and increase transparencyâ€”especially in mission-driven sectors. Iâ€™m always learning, building, and contributing. This portfolio reflects the journey Iâ€™m on, the work Iâ€™ve done, and the impact I aim to make.</p>
